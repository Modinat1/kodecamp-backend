// 2. Write an api that has the same feature as question number one. Let me describe it to you.

// The APi should have the following features:

// a) An array names “products” that keeps the product.

// b) A GET “/products” route to get the products

// c) A GET “/products/:id” route to get a product by it’s ID

// d) A POST “/products” route to add a new product

// e) A PATCH “/products/:id” route that allows product edit (except editing the stock status)

// f) A PATCH “/products/:id/:status” route that allows a product’s status to be changed only

// g) A DELETE “/products/:id” route that allows a product to be deleted

 

// Note: For question 2, don’t worry about adding the shop name and shop location to question 2. Submit a github repository link for question 2.
